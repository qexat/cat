# Category theory stuff in OCaml

todo: need to be finished at some point idk

mostly functorial typeclasses using the module system but there's more :P

to see an example of use:

```sh
opam exec -- dune exec cat
```

also there are some monads such as `Option` defined in [`lib/monad.ml`](./lib/monad.ml)
